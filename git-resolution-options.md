# Git Divergence Resolution Options

## Current Situation

- Local main branch HEAD: 9f0de57efa10d1a9936c4f6da3799114fa2ac9d7
- Remote main branch HEAD: 1a478a1f34f6e617a317d82a3cdea71ba891177a
- The branches have diverged, meaning there are commits on both branches that are not present on the other.

## Option 1: Merge

**Command:** `git config pull.rebase false` then `git pull origin main`

This will create a merge commit that combines both branches.

- Preserves the complete history of both branches
- Creates a merge commit which shows when the reconciliation happened
- Safe option that doesn't rewrite history

## Option 2: Rebase

**Command:** `git config pull.rebase true` then `git pull origin main`

This will replay your local commits on top of the remote branch.

- Creates a linear history
- Rewrites your local commit history
- May cause conflicts if there are overlapping changes

## Option 3: Fast-forward only

**Command:** `git config pull.ff only` then `git pull origin main`

This will only update your branch if it can be fast-forwarded (if your local commits are a direct ancestor of the remote).

- Since the branches have diverged, this would fail in the current situation
- Would require resetting your local branch first
