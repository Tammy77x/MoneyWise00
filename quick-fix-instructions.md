# Quick Fix for Git Divergence Issue

Run these commands in your terminal to resolve the git pull error:

```bash
# 1. Configure git to use merge instead of rebase
git config pull.rebase false

# 2. Now pull the changes from the remote repository
git pull origin main
```

That's it! These two commands will resolve the divergence issue.

## What if you get conflicts?

If you see messages about merge conflicts:

1. Open the files that git indicates have conflicts
2. Look for sections with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`
3. Edit those sections to keep the code you want
4. Save the files
5. Add them to git: `git add .`
6. Complete the merge: `git commit`

## Verify it worked

After running the commands, check that everything is working:

```bash
git status
```

You should see "nothing to commit, working tree clean" if successful.
